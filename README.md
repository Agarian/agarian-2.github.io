# Agarian-2.github.io
Experimental client for my agar.io server.
This client can be used for any agar.io server (assuming it's MultiOgar based).

Things to note:
 - Skins are broken at the moment.
 - I am not in a position to help anybody who has an issue with my client, unless I find it necessary.
 - This client is NOT owned by me (original located at https://github.com/Luka967/Cigar).
 - Update will usually come often.
